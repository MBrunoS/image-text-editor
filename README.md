# Image Text Editor

Simple text editor for images enabling multiple texts, size, color, shadow, position and alignment manipulation. Also enable download as a PDF with 4 images per sheet. Created using Konva and jsPDF.

## Motivation

I was asked to create a project where people could edit some predefined images with the address of local events. So it started as a specific use case and then I realized it could become more generic.

## Live Demo

## Creation Process Thinking

I wanted to create it with the minimal dependencies needed, as a form of challenge to myself. Then the code recreates, in some ways, some concepts as State management, Componentization and Utilities CSS.

## TO-DO

- [ ] The PDF shouldn't stretch the image
- [ ] Font selection
